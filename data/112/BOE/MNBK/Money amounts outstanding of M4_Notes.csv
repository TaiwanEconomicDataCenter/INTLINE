[a],"In December 1995, a one-off transaction involving the repayment of loans within one banking group depressed M4 and its sterling lending counterpart by some £1.1bn. (31 Dec 1995)"
[b],"National & Provincial Building Society transferred its business to Abbey National plc; its data are now included within the banking sector rather than the building society sector.

[d],It is estimated that some £5bn (nsa) of the fall in wholesale M4 reflected the run-down of gilt repo activity over the calendar year-end; this was unwound in January. (31 Dec 1996 - 31 Jan 1997)
[e],Alliance & Leicester Building Society converted to public limited company status; its data are now included within the banking sector rather than the building society sector.

[k],The one-month growth rate of wholesale M4 was depressed by 1.4pp (sa) due to the reversal of the unusual transaction which boosted wholesale M4 by the same amount in May. (30 Jun 1999)
[l],"The growth of total M4 was boosted by at least £4 bn (nsa), in part by transactions associated with Lloyds TSB's acquisition of Scottish Widows and corporate cash management activity in advance of payments due in early September for UK third generation mobile phone licences. (31 Aug 2000)"
[m],M4 was depressed by 0.2pp as a result of the unwinding of corporate cash management activity that took place in August 2000 (30 Sep 2000)
[n],M4 was boosted by £2.6bn in September 2004 as a result of changes in the way a group is managing its interest rate risk ahead of the move to International Accounting Standards (IAS). (30 Sep 2004)
[o],"Following the transition of building societies' statistical reporting from the FSA to the Bank of England on 1 January 2008, some minor changes to the building societies' contribution to the calculation of M4 and M4 lending have been implemented.  The effects of these have been removed from the flows data, and are small in terms of the amounts outstanding. (31 Jan 2008)"
[p],"From April 2009 data onwards, banks' and building societies' own covered bond entities are treated as part of the bank or building society. Positions between banks/building societies and their covered bond entities are netted out. This led to a £21 billion fall in the amount outstanding of M4. These effects have been removed from the flows (changes) data. (30 Apr 2009)"
